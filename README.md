# SFA-Project-scheduling-football-appointments-

In the htdocs file, create a football directory in which you will insert the project folders,
after that in XAMPP in the httpd.conf file change the paths to DocumentRoot, set them to:

DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/football/"
<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/football/">

The attached project also contains a dump of the SQL database where the USER and scheduled appointments will be stored.

This time I tried harder for the Back-End part of the site, so the Front was a little behind, my goal was to make the functionality of scheduling appointments and the AdminPanel.
